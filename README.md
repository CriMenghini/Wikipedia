## Get in touch with Wikipedia 

The task of this little work is to:

* Find all articles in Italian and Portuguese that mention Matteo Renzi;
* Rank them by how frequently they were viewed in November.

Then to play a bit with data:

* Explore the differences between IT and PT in terms of numbers and plots. Are there distinct differences between the languages in terms of what kinds of articles mention Renzi? What's the distribution of number of Renzi mentions per article in IT vs. PT?
